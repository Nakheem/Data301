    *This is a solo research project *
   
  *The data in this dataset is provided by **Riot Games**.* 
 It focuses on the popular PC game League of Legends, commonly referred to as just “League”. In 2020 the game had 115 million registered players from around the world and the company made around 3 billion dollars using a free to play model. 
The data in the dataset is various statistic from ranked games of League of Legends.  Specifically, this data set focuses on the ranked games of the top 1% of League of Legends players.  
The data was collected using the Riot Api, it was collected April 2020. Riot games releases all the stats on their games to the public. It can be accessed directly thorough riot games or 
through many third-party companies or websites, such as mobalityics or proguides.The purpose of this dataset is to see how skilled player win their games. Games played at this higher level 
tend to be faster and more decisive, and it is interesting to see which stats contribute to their win. The data contained in the data set includes starts like kills, death,
towers taken, gold differences and major objectives. 
    I am interested in this data set because I League of Legends is one of my favorite games, and I sit around the top 5% of players. By League of Legends standard, I am already very
good at the game but there are still players that are better than me. And maybe these statics will shed somelight on what I can do to improve. I interested in which stats are leading to 
victories, especially the various warding states, as this has been heralded to be a major improving point for most players. And comparing this a stat like kills, the stat that most lower ranked players tend to 
focus on. I am also curious about the towers taken because if this stat is too high then it shows that one team “opened” or just gave up the game. An example of this would be if the towers were about 5,
which is minimum amount need to end a game.  

<h1>Research questions</h1>

- What matters more wards or kills
- Does taking towers effect the game
- How much does a gold difference this early in the game make
