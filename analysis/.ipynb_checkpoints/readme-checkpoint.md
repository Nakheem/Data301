This directory contains the analysis of the data set. This is a solo project so there is only only the analysis of one person



<h1>Intial idea</h1>

- Original idea was to splic the date interms red and blue teams based on which side one, and recombine the data but with out the red or blue. later realised id lose a lot of data 
- Decided to keep the losing team data, and just rename the entire table. So I split the data interms of red or blue winning and reframed the data with winner being the primary data 
  and the loser being secondary

<h1> EDA <h1>
- After doing EDA realised I should make use of count functions to get precentages of likelyhood of winining
- Also realsed doublesided bar graphs would be usefull
- Trying a heat map
